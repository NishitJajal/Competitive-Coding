// In this question we have to find the power of the number by using binary conversion.

// Approach :- We will convert power in binary form.
// Step 2 :- If there is a 1 then we will consider that number in result. Otherwise we will end up with squering that base number.

class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        long binForm = n;
        double resultant = 1;
        
        if (n < 0){
            x = 1/x;
            binForm = -binForm;
        }
        while (binForm > 0){
            if (binForm%2==1){
                resultant *= x;
                x *= x;
            }else {
                x *= x;
            }
            binForm /= 2;
        }
        return resultant;
    }
